You’ll encounter obstacles such as tunnels, fences, tyre walls, climbing nets and balancing bars, as well as a range of natural terrain, including fallen trees, river banks, ditches, hills and streams. You’ll struggle to overcome the hurdles, difficulties and discomfort placed before you, and in the process learn a lot about yourself.

							Completing this challenge today was such an amazing experience, to say the least <em>masha’Allah!</em>
						</p>

						<p>
							Truly it was a great team and <em>iman</em> building task. Extremely trying at times, but so much fun. I would encourage many more sisters to take part in it. <em>Alhumdulilah</em>, such a great sense of achievement after having completed it.
						</p>

						<p>
							<em>Subhan’Allah</em> doing this in thought of all those people who have been displaced from their homes and having to make these extremely difficult and dangerous journeys all the way through Europe, has truly made me so grateful for everything I have, having only experienced a fraction of what our brothers and sisters have had to go through.
						</p>

						<p>
							<em>Insha’Allah</em>, I will never forget this day.

						<p>
							At first, you'll regret wearing that nice abaya, but you'll be glad you did. It will make you appreciate what refugees go through when they have to leave everything they love behind.
						</p>

						<p>
							The sense of loss and regret you feel as the challenge proceeds will be so strong. It's very powerful and profound.
						</p>

						<p>
							You'll find yourself mourning this one material possession of yours, just a dress, and it will make you realise just how hard life must be for someone who loses everything.
						</p>

						<p>
							Wear that one outfit you're really attached to. <em>Subhan’Allah</em> this experience will change you. <em>Insha’Allah</em>, you will be more grateful for what you have.

									</div>
								</div>
								<div class="card-body">
									<p>
										No, we do not make any money from Refugee Run, nor do we ask you for money or handle money in any way.
										The fees mentioned are for the hire of venue only, and go directly to the venue.
										Our only aim is to help you raise funds for your own nominated good cause.
